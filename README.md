# Post-Job-Crawler
Simple website that gets the post-jobs from simplyhired and show it to you the user, also can get values and filter them for customized search


I used bs4 and selenium in this project to get the post from those websites 
here I faced the challange that I couldn't get the react or vue js dynamic elements with only bs4 so I had to use selenium to get full contents of websites
